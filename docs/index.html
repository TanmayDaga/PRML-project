            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>This project explores the relationship between social media sentiment and stock market movements. Specifically, we analyze Reddit posts related to different market sectors to determine if sentiment expressed on these platforms can predict stock price movements.</p>
            
            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <p>Social media has become an increasingly influential factor in financial markets, with communities like Reddit's r/wallstreetbets demonstrating the power of retail investor sentiment. This project aims to quantify this relationship by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Collecting Reddit posts related to specific companies across different sectors</li>
                <li>Analyzing the sentiment of these posts using NLP techniques</li>
                <li>Correlating this sentiment with actual stock price movements</li>
                <li>Building predictive models to forecast stock movement based on Reddit sentiment</li>
            </ul>

        <div class="container">
            <h2>Methodology</h2>
            
            <h3>Data Collection</h3>
            <p>Our data collection process involves two main components:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Reddit Data:</strong> Using PRAW (Python Reddit API Wrapper), we collected posts mentioning specific companies from relevant subreddits. The date range for collection was January 2025 to March 2025.</li>
                <li><strong>Stock Price Data:</strong> Using Yahoo Finance API (yfinance), we gathered daily stock data for the ETFs representing each sector.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <h3>Text Processing</h3>
            <p>The collected Reddit posts underwent several preprocessing steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Removal of URLs, special characters, and Reddit-specific formatting</li>
                <li>Conversion to lowercase</li>
                <li>Tokenization and stop word removal</li>
                <li>Vectorization using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Sentiment Labeling</h3>
            <p>Rather than using conventional sentiment analysis tools, we created a market-based labeling approach:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Each Reddit post was labeled based on the actual ETF movement for that sector on the day of the post</li>
                <li>Posts made on days when the ETF closed higher than it opened were labeled as "1" (positive)</li>
                <li>Posts made on days when the ETF closed lower than or equal to its opening price were labeled as "0" (negative)</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Model Training</h3>
            <p>We trained four different types of models for each sector to identify which approach works best:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Support Vector Machine (SVM):</strong> A powerful classifier that finds the optimal hyperplane to separate classes</li>
                <li><strong>Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA):</strong> A dimensionality reduction technique that also works well as a classifier</li>
                <li><strong>Naive Bayes:</strong> A probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions</li>
                <li><strong>Artificial Neural Network (ANN):</strong> A multi-layer perceptron network with hidden layers of 64 and 32 neurons</li>
            </ol>

            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            
            <h3>Key Findings</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Reddit sentiment does have predictive value for stock market movements, but with varying degrees of accuracy across sectors.</li>
                <li>Technology and Arms & Defense sectors showed the strongest relationship between Reddit sentiment and stock movements.</li>
                <li>SVM models generally outperformed other approaches, suggesting linear separability in the feature space.</li>
                <li>The most predictive features were often sector-specific terminology related to financial factors, industry-specific events, and macroeconomic conditions.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Limited timespan of data (January-March 2025)</li>
                <li>Imbalanced representation across different sectors on Reddit</li>
                <li>Potential confounding variables not accounted for in the model</li>
                <li>Binary classification approach simplifies complex market dynamics</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Future Work</h3>
            <p>Future extensions of this project could include:</p>

                <li>Expanding to more sectors and companies</li>
                <li>Incorporating sentiment from other social media platforms</li>
                <li>Using more granular time scales (intraday movements)</li>
                <li>Developing trading strategies based on the predictive models</li>
                <li>Implementing real-time sentiment monitoring and alerts</li>
